Learn to create Machine Learning Algorithms in Python from two Data Science experts in accordance to the course 'Machine Learning A-Z' on udemy.

Interested in the field of Machine Learning and don't know where to start from? Then this course is for you!

This course has been designed by two professional Data Scientists so that they can share their knowledge and help you learn complex theory, algorithms and coding libraries in a simple way.

This course is fun and exciting. It is structured the following way:

Part 1 - Data Preprocessing
Part 2 - Regression: Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, SVR, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression
Part 3 - Classification: Logistic Regression, K-NN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification
Part 4 - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering
Part 5 - Association Rule Learning: Apriori, Eclat
Part 6 - Reinforcement Learning: Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling
Part 7 - Natural Language Processing: Bag-of-words model and algorithms for NLP
Part 8 - Deep Learning: Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks
Part 9 - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA
Part 10 - Model Selection & Boosting: k-fold Cross Validation, Parameter Tuning, Grid Search, XGBoost

What are the requirements?
Just some high school mathematics level.
